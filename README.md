# CCProjectGenerator

This tool is the official installer for cocos2d-objc and was introduced since v3.5. It is made for easy creating template projects.
As of XCTemplates are unsupported, undocumented by Apple and are just a hell on the earth, I decided to stick to manual project generation, since it is more flexible for us and less painful.

It allows you to create pure Swift/Objective-C project with 3 targets (iOS, Mac and tvOS) + Chipmunk physics engine and SpriteBuilder files as options.

Some of project-generation code was extracted from SpriteBuilder repo.
